Project Title: Classification of Variable Stars with Machine Learning


For our project, we are training a model that can classify different types of variable stars, which are stars whose brightness appears to change over time. To train this model, we’re using the ASASSN dataset, a collection of approximately 378,000 lightcurves (measurements of the star’s brightness over a period of time) categorized by 19 different classifications. To prepare this data for training, we downsampled overrepresented classes, normalized the data by distance, and dropped data points that were extreme outliers. Our ultimate goal is to have a model with solid performance across multiple varying datasets, which could be used to identify interesting candidates for further observation.
